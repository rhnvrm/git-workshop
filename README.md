# Minimal Workshop Leaderboard

I recently conducted a workshop on [Git](https://slides.com/rhnvrm/git). In this workshop, the participants were supposed to solve a set of questions in level that covered a single topic and then be given a hint to proceed to the next level. I wanted to motivate the participants using a simple leaderboard so that they could see the progress of their peers in real time.

## How to use

1. Run `server.py` on the speakers machine.
2. Run `display.py` on the machine connected to the projector.
3. Distribute `insert.py` to the participants and ask them to run the file whenever they complete a level.
